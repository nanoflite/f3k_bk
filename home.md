# 2012 F3K Belgian Championship

Welcome to the overview of the results for the Belgian championship F3K season 2012.

## Belgian contests

We flew 6 contests this year, from which 4 count for the end result. Four each pilot, we retire the 2 least scores.

## International contests

Some Belgian pilots fly internal contests. 

## Selection for the World Championships 2013

The criterium to get selected for the world championship 2013 was to get 90% on one FAI approved international contest. The order in which the selection works is by adding the total of the Belgian contests score to the best international score, giving a result on 500.

## How was this made?

A python script works on some csv files and spits out this site.
