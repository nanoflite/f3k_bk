# 2016 F3K Belgian Championship

Welcome to the overview of the results for the Belgian championship F3K season 2016.

## Belgian contests

We flew 7 contests this year, from which 5 count for the end result. For each pilot, we retire the worst score.

This score table only contains results for the Belgian pilots.

## How was this made?

A python script works on some csv files and spits out this site.
